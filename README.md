**Rec** is a simple framework to check and transform data record files(like CSV).
It provides several DSL to describe the relationships and transformation rules
 to check the data correctness and integrity.

Rec v2 is currently under design, and you can see doc/design.md for details.

For v1 document, see doc/v1.md.
